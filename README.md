# cost-of-living-web-scraping-eda
Python project involving web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of global cost of living data.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global cost of living data collected from public web sources. 
The goal is to compare income, cost of living, and purchasing power across countries 
to identify affordability patterns and financially stressed regions.

## Objectives
- Scrape tabular cost of living data from a public website
- Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create derived metrics to assess affordability
- Visualize insights using Python

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- BeautifulSoup
- Matplotlib

## Key Analysis Performed
- Income vs Cost of Living comparison
- Identification of countries with low income and high living costs
- Analysis of purchasing power relative to cost of living
- Feature engineering using affordability ratios

## Visualizations
- Scatter plot: Monthly Income vs Cost of Living Index
- Bar chart: Countries with high cost of living and below-average income

## Files in This Repository
- `Cost_of_Living_scrapping.ipynb` – Complete analysis notebook
- `cost_of_living_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights significant differences in affordability across countries and 
identifies regions where high living costs create financial pressure despite lower income 
or purchasing power.
